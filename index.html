            Set your mind to island time without leaving the mainland states.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The islands are wonderous with unique sites you would miss anywhere
            else. If you rent a boat go to June Island, where you will find tiny
            deer that get all of their liquids from plants (they especially love
            canteloupe). If you want a guided tour, you can get on a boat to see
            orcas, or ride across the islands to learn its history.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no shortage of activities for the whole family. For history
            buffs there are museums. For exploreres there are tours and hikes.
            For life-long learners there are aquariums, more museums, and camps.
            For the foodies in your life there is fabulous food wherever you go.

            <p>
              Book a tour to get on a boat and search with an experience team to
              find the native Orca pods.

            <h5>Why I recommend it</h5>
            <p>
              These pods are native to the San Juan Islands, and there are no
              words to describe the awe you feel when you see an orca breach the
              water or jump for joy. These magnificent creatures bring you to
              the present moment every time.

            <h4>Kayak Tour</h4>
            <p>
              Get active and up close with nature by hopping in a kayak and
              going form island to island.

            <h5>Why I recommend it</h5>
            <p>
              On a motorized boat it is easy to miss the creatures that hide
              from the noise. On a kayak, you can be quiet enough to see a bear
              coming to the water or a falcon taking flight to catch a fish.

            <h4>Boating</h4>
            <p>
              Explore more on your own by renting a boat! Check out islands you
              can't get to otherwise.

            <h5>Why I recommend it</h5>
            <p>
              Tours are all well and good, but exploring on your own allows you
              to find places unplanned that you might otherwise have missed.
              Sleep on a boat under the stars. Feed canteloupe to tiny deer. You
              never know what you might find.

          <p>
            Hi! My name is Kim and the San Juan Islands have been a special
            place to visit for many years. I'm very fond of the islands. I

            develop my coding skills.
